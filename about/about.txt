Weather widget with current weather, daily and hourly forecast.
To work, you need to get the api key on the website https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys and set it to the app settings.
Some devices do not support hourly forecast. Because they don't have enough memory to process the web request.
The first launch is long because the weather pictures are downloaded. Be patient. It will be faster on next launches.
To capture a location, use activity with gps or set the time by gps and launch widget. You can also set the location in the app settings.
